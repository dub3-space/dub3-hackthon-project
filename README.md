Welcome to dub3.ai, where your voice takes center stage! üé§

## About

dub3.ai is an innovative marketplace harnessing the power of Cartesi, enabling users to transform their voice into unique NFTs and generate text-to-speech content using cutting-edge AI technology. üåü

## Project Goal

Our main objective is to empower users to effortlessly upload and monetize their voice samples. These samples undergo advanced processing through the Coqui/TTS library by Hugging Face. The magic unfolds within the Cartesi environment, ensuring seamless, efficient, and reliable execution. Once synthesized, the resulting voice is securely uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Simultaneously, an exclusive NFT is minted, representing this synthesized voice as a one-of-a-kind digital asset. üí´

## How It Works

## Tech Stack
For this project several components have been integrated.

### Cartesi
It is used to execute the Text2Speech model inference and various actions such as uploading the output file to ipfs via Pinata.

### Chainlink 
Chainlink CCIP is used to enable cross-chain communication in order to mint the NFTs on Polygon Mumbai from other chains. 

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse is used to store securely the audio files generated by the AI.

### Scroll
