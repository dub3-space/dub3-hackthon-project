# Voice-to-NFT Text-to-Speech Synthesizer 🔊🎨

This repository hosts an innovative application that harnesses the power of synthesizers to create unique voice outputs, turning them into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) usable for text-to-speech functionality.

## Overview 🌟

The goal of this project is to enable users to upload their voice samples, which are then processed using the Coqui/TTS library from Hugging Face. The synthesis occurs within a Cartesi environment, ensuring efficient and reliable execution. The resulting synthesized voice is then uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), and an NFT is minted from this synthesized voice.

## How It Works 🚀

1. **Voice Upload:** Users upload their voice samples to the application.
2. **Synthesis:** The Coqui/TTS library running in a Cartesi environment processes the voice sample to create a synthesized voice output.
3. **IPFS Upload:** The synthesized voice is uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized storage and accessibility.
4. **NFT Minting:** An NFT is created from the synthesized voice, serving as a unique identifier and usable for text-to-speech functionality.
