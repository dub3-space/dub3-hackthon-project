Welcome to dub3.ai, where your voice takes center stage! 🎤

## About

dub3.ai is an innovative marketplace harnessing the power of Cartesi, enabling users to transform their voice into unique NFTs and generate text-to-speech content using cutting-edge AI technology. 🌟

## Project Goal

Our main objective is to empower users to effortlessly upload their voice samples. These samples undergo advanced processing through the Coqui/TTS library by Hugging Face. The magic unfolds within the Cartesi environment, ensuring seamless, efficient, and reliable execution. Once synthesized, the resulting voice is securely uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Simultaneously, an exclusive NFT is minted, representing this synthesized voice as a one-of-a-kind digital asset. 💫

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Voice:** Share your unique voice samples.
2. **AI Synthesis:** Cutting-edge AI processes your voice via the Coqui/TTS library.
3. **Cartesi Environment:** Seamless execution within the Cartesi environment.
4. **IPFS Storage:** Securely store the synthesized voice on IPFS.
5. **NFT Creation:** Mint a unique NFT representing your synthesized voice.
